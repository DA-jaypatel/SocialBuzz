# Project SocialBuzz

Hey Folks!
In this project, I have carried out analytics(Collection and modelling of data, visualizations and story telling) for the content database of an online platform named SocialBuzz as a part of my virtual internship. The repository contains all the sample dataset that were provided, the final dataset that was prepared after cleaning and merging the sample datasets. Along with that, the visualizations generated and the powerpoint presentation for story telling have also been included. This analytics was carried out in Excel and PowerQuery feature was used.

Yours friendly.
Jay Patel.
